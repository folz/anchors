# Getting Started

Anchors is a utility library for position anchoring. It helps you
create floating elements like tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns,
using the time-tested position solver of Floating UI.

<CircleImage name="intro" inline={introInline} />

Anchor a floating element (such as a tooltip) to another element
(such as a button) while simultaneously ensuring it stays in view
as best as possible by avoiding collisions.

## Why

We want the ability to conceptually "anchor" the position of a
floating element, so that its position is to be declaratively
tied to the position of some other UI element. This behavior is
difficult to get right on the web.

Making sure a floating element remains anchored next to another
element can be challenging, considering all the ways CSS can
affect layout and all the ways DOM elements can be positioned
around.

Absolute positioning can also be an issue when the floating
element is too close to the edge of a viewport and becomes
obscured, an event called a collision. When a collision would
happen, the anchoring position needs to be adjusted so the
floating element stays visible.

Anchors handles scroll overflow, CSS offsets, positioning
contexts, and more, powered by
[Floating UI](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui)'s
constraint engine. It uses a well-tested approach that
efficiently calculates the positioning needed to anchor one
element to another while handling any adjustments necessary to
account for CSS layout effects.

## Install

```shell
npm install @folz/anchors
npm install @folz/anchors-react
# or
yarn add @folz/anchors
yarn add @folz/anchors-react
# or
pnpm install @folz/anchors
pnpm install @folz/anchors-react
```

### Vanilla

Use on the [web](/docs/computePosition) with vanilla JavaScript
(`dom` refers to the
[Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
to work with HTML/SVG elements).

### React

Use with [React DOM](/docs/react)

#### React DOM

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/react
```

### Vue

Use with [Vue](/docs/vue).

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/vue
```

### Canvas or other platforms

If you're targeting a platform other than the vanilla DOM (web),
React, or React Native, you can create your own
[Platform](/docs/platform). This allows you to support things
like Canvas/WebGL, or other platforms that can run JavaScript.

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/core
```

## CDN

Anchors can be loaded via CDN using ESM or UMD format.

### ESM

```js
import {computePosition} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__/+esm';
```

### UMD

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__"></script>
```

All exports will be available on `window.AnchorsDOM{:js}`.

## Migration from Floating UI or Popper.js

If you are coming to Anchors from Floating UI or Popper.js, there
is a [migration guide available here](/docs/migration).
