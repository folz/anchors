# Getting Started

Anchors is a library that helps you create "floating" elements
such as tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, and more.

<CircleImage name="intro" inline={introInline} />

It offers two main features:

1. **Anchor positioning**: Anchor a floating element (such as a
   tooltip) to another element (such as a button) while
   simultaneously ensuring it stays in view as best as possible
   by avoiding collisions. This feature is available for all
   platforms.
2. **User interactions for React**: Hooks and components for
   composing interactions to create accessible floating UI
   components.

## Why

Floating elements are absolutely positioned, typically anchored
to another UI element. Ensuring a floating element remains
anchored next to another element can be challenging, especially
in unique layout contexts like scrolling containers.

Absolute positioning can also cause problems when the floating
element is too close to the edge of the viewport and becomes
obscured, also known as a collision. When a collision occurs, the
position must be adjusted to ensure the floating element remains
visible.

Further, floating elements are often interactive, which can raise
complex accessibility issues when designing user interactions.

Anchors offers a set of low-level features to help you navigate
these challenges and build accessible floating UI components.

## Install

To install Anchors, you can use a package manager like npm or a
CDN. There are different versions available for different
platforms.

### Vanilla

Use on the [web](/docs/computePosition) with vanilla JavaScript
(`dom` refers to the
[Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
to work with HTML/SVG elements).

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

### React

Use with [React DOM](/docs/react) or
[React Native](/docs/react-native).

#### React DOM

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/react
```

#### React Native

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/react-native
```

### Vue

Use with [Vue](/docs/vue).

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/vue
```

### Canvas or other platforms

If you're targeting a platform other than the vanilla DOM (web),
React, or React Native, you can create your own
[Platform](/docs/platform). This allows you to support things
like Canvas/WebGL, or other platforms that can run JavaScript.

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/core
```

## CDN

Anchors can be loaded via CDN using ESM or UMD format.

### ESM

```js
import {computePosition} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__/+esm';
```

### UMD

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__"></script>
```

All exports will be available on `window.FloatingUIDOM{:js}`.

## Migration from Floating UI or Popper.js

If you are coming to Anchors from Floating UI or Popper.js, there
is a [migration guide available here](/docs/migration).
