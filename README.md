[Anchors](https://folz.github.io/anchors) is a library to position floating
elements like tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns in robust and configurable ways.
It targets synchronous, vanilla DOM APIs for ease of integration with Web UI
frameworks.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {computePosition, roundByDPR, shift} from '@folz/anchors';
import {useAtomValue} from 'jotai';
import {mouseCoords$} from './atoms';

/**
 * A layout component anchored to track the mouse cursor position.
 */
export const Mousetip = (props: Props) => {
  const ref = React.useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null);
  const mouseCoords = useAtomValue(mouseCoords$);

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (!ref.current) return;

    const {x, y} = computePosition(mouseCoords, ref.current, {
      placement: 'top',
      middleware: [shift({crossAxis: true})],
    });

    Object.assign(ref.current.style, {
      top: `0px`,
      left: `0px`,
      transform: `translate(${roundByDPR(x)}px, ${roundByDPR(y)}px)`,
    });
  }, [mouseCoords]);

  return <span ref={ref}>{props.children}</span>;
};

type Props = React.PropsWithChildren<{}>;
```

```tsx
import {atom} from 'jotai';
import {radEventListener} from 'rad-event-listener';

export const mouse$ = atom({x: 0, y: 0});
mouse$.onMount = (setAtom) =>
  radEventListener(window, 'mousemove', ({clientX: x, clientY: y}) => {
    setAtom({x, y});
  });

export const mouseCoords$ = atom((get) => {
  const {x, y} = get(mouse$);

  return {
    getBoundingClientRect() {
      return {width: 0, height: 0, x, y, left: x, right: x, top: y, bottom: y};
    },
  };
});

## Why

We want the ability to conceptually "anchor" the position of a floating element,
so that its position is to be declaratively tied to the position of some other
UI element. This behavior is difficult to get right on the web.

Making sure a floating element remains anchored next to another element can be
challenging, what with all the different layout rules in CSS, plus all the ways
that elements can be moved around.

Absolute positioning can also be an issue when the floating element is too close
to the edge of a viewport and becomes obscured, an event called a collision.
When a collision would happen, the anchoring position needs to be adjusted so
the floating element stays visible.

Anchors uses a well-tested approach created by
[Floating UI](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui) that efficiently
calculates the positioning needed to anchor one element to another, and makes
any adjustments necessary to account for CSS layout rules also in effect.

## Getting started

```shell
npm install @folz/anchors
npm install @folz/anchors-react
# or
yarn add @folz/anchors
yarn add @folz/anchors-react
# or
pnpm install @folz/anchors
pnpm install @folz/anchors-react
```

You can either start by
[reading the Floating UI tutorial](https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial), which
teaches you how to use the library by building a basic tooltip, or you can jump
right into the
[Floating UI API documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/computePosition).
To translate to Anchors APIs, you'll mostly need to replace `await`s and
`Promise`s in examples with a synchronous equivalent.

Anchors-specific documentation is coming soonâ„¢.

## Contributing

This project is a monorepo written in TypeScript using pnpm workspaces. The
website is using Next.js SSG and Tailwind CSS for styling.

- Fork and clone the repo
- Install dependencies in root directory with `pnpm install`
- Build initial package dist files with `pnpm run build`

### Testing

`pnpm --filter "@folz/anchors" run dev` in the root will launch the
`@folz/anchors` development visual tests at `http://localhost:1234`. The
playground uses React to write each test route, bundled by Vite.

Each route has screenshots taken of the page by Playwright to ensure all the
functionalities work as expected; this is an easy, reliable and high-level way
of testing the positioning logic.

Below the main container are UI controls to turn on certain state and options.
Every single combination of state is tested visually via the snapshots to cover
as much as possible.

## Credits

Anchors is a fork of [Floating UI](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui).
At a high level:

- Anchors is synchronous:
  ```ts
  const {x, y, ...rest} = computePosition({
    /* ... */
  });
  ```
- Floating UI is asynchronous:

  ```ts
  computePosition({
    /* ... */
  }).then(({x, y, ...rest}) => {
    /* ... */
  });

  // or

  const {x, y, ...rest} = await computePosition({
    /* ... */
  });
  ```

- Anchors removes Floating UI's "platform" abstraction. It targets Web DOM APIs
  directly
- Anchors will probably not support React Native
  - Floating UI currently supports React Native
  - This was the tradeoff that enabled a synchronous API
  - This also meant we could remove some abstraction layers, which means Anchors
    runs less code per `computePosition()`
    - _(This is pretty much the main difference between the two projects.)_
- Anchors currently does not support Vue
  - Floating UI currently supports Vue
  - Anchors should be able to support Vue in the future

## Behavior parity with Floating UI

Anchors will aim to keep behavior parity with Floating UI by cherry-picking new
Floating UI changes into this repository. If you experience a difference in
behavior between Anchors and Floating UI, please open an issue.
